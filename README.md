## üéä Task Description:

Our company is focused on building websites based on Cricket. Currently, we are in search of a MERN Stack developer to develop our upcoming website.

### üßÆ Website Theme:

The "Dream 11" website aims to create a comprehensive user experience centered around fantasy cricket. The core functionality of this platform revolves around user interaction with players and teams. When a user visits the website, the first step is to select a cricket-playing country from a list of available options. This choice sets the stage for the subsequent user experience.

Once a country is selected, the website will display a list of players belonging to that particular national cricket team. This player roster will feature basic information about each player, enabling users to browse and explore their options. This initial view provides users with a snapshot of the available talent pool for their dream team.

Upon selecting a player's name from the list, users can access detailed player profiles. These profiles include comprehensive information about the player, such as their career statistics, performance history, and other relevant details. This feature is designed to help users make informed decisions when selecting players for their dream team.

The dream team creation process is at the heart of the "Dream 11" experience. Users have the freedom to handpick players from the available pool to form their dream cricket team. This involves adding players they believe will perform well in real-life cricket matches. Additionally, the platform allows users to remove players from their dream team if they wish to make changes or adjustments.

User engagement and participation are key aspects of the "Dream 11" website, with the goal of offering an immersive and customizable fantasy cricket experience. By combining the ability to select a country, explore player information, create a dream team, and make player additions and deletions, the platform caters to cricket enthusiasts who want to put their cricket knowledge to the test and compete with other users based on the real-life performance of the players they choose for their dream teams.
